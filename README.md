# Oracle on Windows Plugin

Oracle on Windows Plugin is designed for virtualizing Oracle database running on Windows Platform. This plugin provides all key benefits of virtualization including provisioning, refresh, rewind, etc.

## What Does a Delphix Plugin Do?

Delphix is a data management platform that provides the ability to securely copy and share datasets. Using virtualization, you will ingest your data sources and create virtual data copies, which are full read-write capable database instances that use a small fraction of the resources a normal database copy would require. The Delphix engine has built-in support for interfacing with certain types of datasets, such as Oracle, SQL Server and ASE.

The Delphix virtualization SDK (https://github.com/delphix/virtualization-sdk) provides an interface for building custom data source integrations for the Delphix Dynamic Data Platform. The end users can design/implement a custom plugin which enable them to use custom data source like MongoDB, MySQL, Cassandra, Couchbase or any other datasource similar to built-in dataset types like Oracle, SQL Server, vFiles etc with Delphix Engine.
